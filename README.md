### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

So you're here to investigate who this rando person is? Well, here I am. You would think my GitHub account would be loaded with content, but that's just not the case. The stuff in here is OLD! Maybe I'll update some of those webpack starters at some point, but who knows? All that professional stuff is Private. Sorry! I mostly just teach and build curriculums and courses these days.

## My Udacity Courses

[Front End Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011)  
[Intermediate JavaScript](https://www.udacity.com/course/intermediate-javascript-nanodegree--nd032)  
[Full Stack JavaScript](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-javascript-developer-nanodegree--nd0067) 


## Other stuff
Some other things I've done recently include:
* Helping to build the [Web Dev Bootcamp](https://stjosephctr.org/codetalk/) at the St. Joseph Center in Venice, CA
* Built my friend an app for [Mazetoons](https://mazetoonsapp.com/) during covid to better learn html5 canvas
* Teaching courses for [Develop Intelligence](https://www.developintelligence.com/)
* Built out V1 curriculum for ThriveDX with a super amazing team

## diy.dev
After all this time getting frustrated by bootcamps and the lack of job readiness grads experience, I've decided to fill in some of those gaps. I'm doing so under the name [diy.dev](https://diy.dev). You'll find that things are a bit sparse right now, but need to start somewhere.
